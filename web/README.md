## Logo Story
<img src="./src/Assets/Images/logo-slider.png" height="100">

A diamond shaped graphic element is the primary feature of the logo. Naturally, diamond contains the highest concentration of the pure carbon element. Disconnected diamond shape is also graphically representative of the letter C denoting carbon. The arrowhead represents the recycling of carbon, minimising carbon emissions.
